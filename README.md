## Algorithms

- **Math**
  - [Greatest Common Divisor](greatest-common-divisor/) - calculate the Greatest
    Common Divisor (GCD)
  - [Radian, Degree & Revolution](radian-degree-revn/) - radians to degree and
    revolution and backwards conversion
  - [Quadratic Formula](quadratic-formula/) - decompose a function of time (a
    signal) into the frequencies that make it up
